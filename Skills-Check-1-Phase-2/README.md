# Skills-Check-1-Phase-2

## Instructions

In this repository, you will find a series of .js files designed to test your understanding of foundational JavaScript topics. 

Your goal is to work on the corresponding js files in each folder and check your progress against the SpecRunner. There is no required order for completing the tests. 

If you get stuck, you are welcome to jump around to different files in order to continue to progress.
