# SkillsCheck

## Summary

* This project consists of 4 JavaScript parts and 1 HTML/CSS mockup.
  * The HTML/CSS module has instructions in it's README for expectations.
  * The JavaScript modules have instructions and tests associated using SpecRunner that you will open in the browser.
  * If you get stuck, move on and come back to the problem later.
* You have the whole day to work on this and should get as far as you can.
* Your mentors can help push you in the right direction, but the code should be your own.
* Use this as an opportunity to check your progress and work with your instructor to decide what your focus should be in the coming weeks during your evenings and weekends.
