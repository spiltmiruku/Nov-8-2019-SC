# HTML & CSS Project

In this project, you will be pushed to your HTML & CSS limits.

You should see an `index.html`, `style.css` and `mockup.png` inside the `html-css-1` folder. Take a look at the `mockup.png` file. This is what you will be aiming to replicate. 

This is meant to challenge you. It should be difficult. Don't worry about it being pixel perfect but try your hardest. Also, don't worry about the image of the elephant. It can be an image of whatever you want.

You learn the most from these struggles.

*Good luck!*
